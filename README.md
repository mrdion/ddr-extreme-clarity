DDR EXTREME CLARITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*DDR EXTREME CLARITY* is a mod for the game *Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME*
that adds "FAST" and "SLOW" judgment indicators to the in-game UI.

Relative timing indicators are complementary to verbal judgment indicators in 
almost all modern rhythm games. With the addition of "MARVELOUS" timing in 
*DDR EXTREME PRO*, this additional UI can assist players in achieving more 
accurate scoring in a version of the game that has famously had very strict 
timing.
